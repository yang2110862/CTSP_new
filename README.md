# CTSP_new

The colored traveling salesmen problem (CTSP) is a generalization of the popular
traveling salesman problem with multiple salesmen. In CTSP, the cities are divided
into m exclusive city sets (m is the number of salesmen) and one shared city set.
The goal of CTSP is to determine a shortest Hamiltonian circuit (also called route
or tour) for each of the m salesmen satisfying that 1) each route includes all cities
of an exclusive city set and some (or all) cities of the shared city set, and 2) each
city of the shared city set is included in one unique route. CTSP is a relevant
model for a number of practical applications and is known to be computationally
challenging.
